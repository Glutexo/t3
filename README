# T3

The T3 is a minimalistic handheld game console.

Specs:
* Power:       3 AA batteries
* Processor:   ESP8266
* Input:       6 buttons (directions, A, B)
* Display:     3×3 truecolor
* Sound:       1-bit PWM piezo

## Usage

When turned on, the console displays a “T3” welcome animation and enters the
game selection menu.
Press left/right to select a game, and press A to launch it.
Currently there is 1 “game” available:

### Dice

Simulates a 6-sided die. Press A to re-roll.
When ready, the result is shown colorfully.

## The emulator

A rudimentary emulator is included to aid development and to run games without
a physical console.
The emulator is not accurate--it runs with the speed and memory of the host
computer--but it's useful for validating high-level logic.

To run the emulator, you will need Python 3.5+ *and* MicroPython, plus the
Pyglet library. On Fedora, you can install the prerequisites with:

    sudo dnf install python3 micropython python3-pyglet

(Please contribute instructions for other systems.
Note: the emulator won't work on Windows without major changes.)

Run the included `t3` script to launch the emulator.
Control it with arrow keys, and Z/X for the A/B buttons.
